## Week 2

By the end of the week all developers can:

* Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
* Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
* Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
* Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
* Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

You may notice you are completing the work quicker and with more ease than your peers. If this sounds like you, it's important to speak to a coach as they can provide additional challenge for you to make sure you continue to progress.

Start attending [process workshops](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/main/process_review) to focus on your developer process. Anyone from any cohort ever can attend.

Watch a [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqKG8j_tgbM) explaining what Reviews are and how to use this valuable resource - and then consider booking one!

### Personal goals of the week

By the end of the weekend challenge:
* Analyze and begin to evaluate spec code good practices, evidenced via
* Apply classes isolation in unit tests using mocking, evidenced by having fully isolated classes in the tests for the Airport weekend challenge,
* Consistently apply OO principles of SRP and encapsulation, evidenced by having applied those principles on the Airport weekend challenge,

### Monday

#### Daily goals

1. Understand ideas and concepts of code review and apply to review another person's code
2. Improve my understanding and application of class isolation in unit testing
3. Work out when the process workshops are so that I can join them in future

### Plan for the day

* Read and apply [code review rubric](https://github.com/makersacademy/airport_challenge/blob/main/docs/review.md) for Airport Challenge
* Read [code review pill](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/pills/code_reviews.md) again, and consider [watching the talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqf4vG2L95Q) and looking through slides
* [Skills workshop on code review](https://github.com/makersacademy/airport_challenge/blob/main/docs/review.md)
* Watch [Makers code review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqKG8j_tgbM) video
* Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

#### Reflection at the end of the day

**achieved**
* Understand ideas and concepts of code review, have read and applied the Airport Challenge rubric and have reviewed another person's code and given feedback. Also reviewed my own. *Wednesday morning update* watched code review talk 
* Isolated class tests on Airport weekend challenge, confirming my understanding of class isolation in unit testing
* *Wednesday morning update* Learned about developer process workshop and planned to attend my first one in week 3

### Tuesday

#### Daily goals
1. Turn up and be present through today, it's a tough day.
2. Improve understanding of spec code good practice 
3. Apply SRP

#### Plan for the day
* Apply Airport code review rubric good practice to tests in Airport challenge
* Apply SRP on Airport code
* Complete Birthday list practical

#### Reflection at the end of the day

**achieved**
* Proud of myself of sticking through the day. Had a good domain modelling workshop and an excellent pairing session. Also got through all that adulting and didn't lose my mind not being able to go run or walk dogs. Sent out invitations to mum's rememberance event.
* Made progress on Airport refactoring, particularly, completed class isolation on tests

### Wednesday

#### Daily goals

1. Improve understanding of spec code good practice, particularly isolation, mocking, behavioural tests
2. Deepen object oriented development conceptualisation

#### Plan for the day
* Finish applying Airport code review rubric good practice to tests in Airport challenge, applying SRP on Airport code
* Complete Birthday list practical
* OO practicals on [encapsulation and cohesion](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/main/practicals/object_oriented_design/encapsulation.md), (dependency injection)[https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/main/practicals/object_oriented_design/dependency_injection.md]
* OO workshops on [concretes and abstracts](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/main/object_oriented_programming/oop_3) and [delegate, delegate, delegate](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/main/object_oriented_programming/oop_3)

#### Reflection at the end of the day

### Thursday

#### Daily goals
