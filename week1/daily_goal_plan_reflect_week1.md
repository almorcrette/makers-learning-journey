## Week 1

### Goals

By the end of the week all developers can:

* Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
* Pair using the driver-navigator style
* Follow an effective debugging process
* Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

#### Wider course goals this week should help with (see all [course goals here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/goals/course_goals.md))

<dl>
  <dt>I can TDD anything</dt>
  <dd>By the end of this week you should be able to write a meaningful test, based on the user requirements. You'll then be able to write code using TDD, to make the test pass.</dd>
  <dt>I can program fluently</dt>
  <dd>You'll learn how to setup and structure a new Ruby project, and turn user requirements into working code.</dd>
  <dt>I can debug anything</dt>
  <dd>You'll be introduced to a technique for uncovering the root-cause of bugs in your code. When your code doesn't work, you'll be able to apply a consistent process to resolve the issue.</dd>
</dl>

### Wednesday

#### Daily goals

<dl>
<dt>Establishing a daily learning  cycle routine</dt>
<dt>Finish setting up my Mac and getting used to </dt>
<dt>OOD:</dt>
  <dd>Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation and SRP,</dd>
  <dd>learning how to setup and structure a new Ruby project, and turn user requirements into working code.</dd>
  <dd>Remind myself `initialize` method, and `attr_reader` and `attr_writer`</dd>
<dt>Get practice working through error messages, particularly digging into the stack trace</dt>
<dt>Practice markdown formatting</dt>
</dl>

#### Day plan

* [Tracking learning] (https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/goals/self_directed_learning/resources/tracking_your_learning.md)
* [Prepare to code setup] (http://www.preparetocode.io/)
* [Encapsulation on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_%28computer_programming%29)
* [Encapsulation](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/main/test_driven_development/oop_1)
* [Encapsulation & Cohesion](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/main/practicals/object_oriented_design/encapsulation.md)
* [Markdown guidance] (https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

#### Reflection at the end of the day

*Achieved*
* Successfully established a first iteration to the learning cycle. Evidence by this makers-learning-journey repo and the weekly and daily routines and documentation
* Finished setting up my Mac and getting used to it. Evidenced by completing a pairing session (4 hours) with the new IDE and receiving 5*s on productivity from my pairing partner
* Practiced markdown formatting. Evidenced by the markdown files in makers-learning-journey
* OOD: progress pairing challenge including completing single responsibility principle, private methods, and magic numbers section. Read encapsulation wikipedia entry. Reminded myself about initalize and attr_reader, writer, accessor. Did not have time for the skill workshop and practical though

_not fully achieved_
* Did not practice opening files in stack trace of errors

### Thursday

#### Daily goals

1. Better understand rspec structure, syntax options, and methods
2. Meet with Rupert and fix the problems we had on challenge 16 of pairing challenge (Boris Bikes)
3. Better understand good practice of SRP on unit tests if that's a thing
4. Have another good pairing session, with good feedback. Particularly get better at research during pairing


#### Day plan

* Watch RSpec tutorial
* Meet with Rupert and fix Challenge 16 of Boris Bikes
* Progress pairing challenge with new partner
* PDD workshop

#### Reflection at the end of the day
