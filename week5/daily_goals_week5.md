## Week 5

If you haven't already, start attending [process workshops](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/main/process_review) or using [Reviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqKG8j_tgbM) to focus on improving your developer process. Anyone from any cohort ever can use these resources!

By the end of the week all developers can build tested, easy-to-change software in a team using these processes:

* Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
* Build to a specification (rather than challenges)
* Run stand-ups and retrospectives
* Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
* Give and receive meaningful code review
