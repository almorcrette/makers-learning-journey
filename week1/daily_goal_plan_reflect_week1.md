## Week 1

### Goals

By the end of the week all developers can:

* Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
* Pair using the driver-navigator style
* Follow an effective debugging process
* Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

#### Wider course goals this week should help with (see all [course goals here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/goals/course_goals.md))

<dl>
  <dt>I can TDD anything</dt>
  <dd>By the end of this week you should be able to write a meaningful test, based on the user requirements. You'll then be able to write code using TDD, to make the test pass.</dd>
  <dt>I can program fluently</dt>
  <dd>You'll learn how to setup and structure a new Ruby project, and turn user requirements into working code.</dd>
  <dt>I can debug anything</dt>
  <dd>You'll be introduced to a technique for uncovering the root-cause of bugs in your code. When your code doesn't work, you'll be able to apply a consistent process to resolve the issue.</dd>
