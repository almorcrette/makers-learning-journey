## Week 7 Review

### Personal goals for the week

* I have deepened my understanding of asynchronicity, callback and promise functions
* I have strengthened my approach to learning a new language and using online material to do so.
* I have test-drive a simple Javascript program running in a web browser, using modern JS build tools.
* I have used the DOM API to build a web user interface for this program.
* I have built a single-page web application fetching and updating remote data using JS.
* I am better at time management: timeboxing, taking breaks, stop working and winding down etc.

Potential additional goal:
* Go through an external code review

### Plan for the week

* Resume exercising everyday, use pomodoro technique to manage breaks and escalation approach to problems I'm stuck on
* Complete the [JS web frontend applications syllabus](https://github.com/makersacademy/javascript-web-applications#sequence)
* Weekend challenge - TBC
* Read the [Calling APIs in Javascript](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/pills/calling_apis_in_javascript.md) explainer about async JS
* Complete the [Reading beyond your level practical](https://hackmd.io/F-pmnp3hRhePddmf3mnKGw)
* Use the pills to strengthen my basic understanding of this week's content: [manipulating the DOM](https://github.com/makersacademy/javascript-web-applications/blob/main/pills/manipulating_dom_with_javascript.md), [Responding to user actions on the page](https://github.com/makersacademy/javascript-web-applications/blob/main/pills/responding_to_user_actions_on_page.md), [setting up a minimal JS frontend project](https://github.com/makersacademy/javascript-web-applications/blob/main/pills/setup_minimal_frontend_webapp.md)
