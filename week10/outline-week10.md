## Week 10

By the end of the week, I will be able to answer yes to this week's primary question:

**Can I solve a challenging technica problem by writing well crafted code?**

By "well crafted code", we mean code that is well tested, easy to read and easy to change.

Secondary goals of the week are to:
- Feel more confident in my ability to complete a tech test.
- Have developed a structured process to approaching complex problems, utilising TDD and good OO design skills
