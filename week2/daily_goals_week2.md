## Week 2

By the end of the week all developers can:

* Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
* Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
* Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
* Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
* Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

You may notice you are completing the work quicker and with more ease than your peers. If this sounds like you, it's important to speak to a coach as they can provide additional challenge for you to make sure you continue to progress.

Start attending [process workshops](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/main/process_review) to focus on your developer process. Anyone from any cohort ever can attend.

Watch a [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqKG8j_tgbM) explaining what Reviews are and how to use this valuable resource - and then consider booking one!

* Consistently apply OO principles of SRP and encapsulation, evidenced via

### Monday

#### Daily goals

1. Understand ideas and concepts of code review and apply to review another person's code
2. Improve my understanding and application of class isolation in unit testing
3. Work out when the process workshops are so thst I can join them in future

### Plan for the day

* Read and apply [code review rubric](https://github.com/makersacademy/airport_challenge/blob/main/docs/review.md) for Airport Challenge
* Read [code review pill](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/pills/code_reviews.md) again, and consider [watching the talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqf4vG2L95Q) and looking through slides
* [Skills workshop on code review](https://github.com/makersacademy/airport_challenge/blob/main/docs/review.md)
* Watch [Makers code review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqKG8j_tgbM) video
* Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback
